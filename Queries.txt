1. How to reset a specific file from a set of files
# Git don't do versioning of specific files separately. It maintains the version of each commit.
# So we first need to know from which specific commit we want to rollback our file. Use below command for that.
git log -p path/to/file

#You'll be able to find the SHA1 (hash) of the commit with the version of the file you want

#Now, all you have to do is this:

# get the version of the file from the given commit
git checkout <commit> path/to/file

# and commit this modification
git commit

#The checkout command first reads the file into the index, then copies it into the work tree
#So there's no need to use git add to add it to the index in preparation for committing.
